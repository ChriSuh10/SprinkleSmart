# SprinkleSmart

SprinkleSmart is a smart sprinkling system that pulls weather data through the OpenWeatherMap API using a Particle Photon, and then responds accordingly. The user sets threshold values using potentiometers attached to the Photon, and can monitor relevant information through the web interface.
